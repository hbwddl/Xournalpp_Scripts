# Xournalpp_Scripts
The folders in this repository each contain a script for use with Xournal++ for Linux. To install, put the scripts in a folder within /usr/share/xournalpp/plugins and turn them on with the plugin manager in Xournal++.
I have only been able to get plugins to work by installing Xournal++ from the stable ppa repository, not from the Ubuntu software center. (https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/blob/master/README.md)
